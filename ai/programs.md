### Legends

- [Logic Theorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Theorist)
	- It was the first program deliberately engineered to mimic the problem solving skills of a human being and is called "the first artificial intelligence program."
	- Logic Theorist soon proved 38 of the first 52 theorems in chapter 2 of the Principia Mathematica.

### Performance evaluations in AI

- optimal: it is not possible to perform better
- strong super-human: performs better than all humans
- super-human: performs better than most humans
- par-human: performs similarly to most humans
- sub-human: performs worse than most humans

##### Optimal

Any solved game (a game whose outcome (win, lose, or draw) can be correctly predicted from any position, given that both players play perfectly) can reach optimal position. 

- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Connect Four
- Checkers
- Rubik's Cube
- Computer poker players, sub-human for full ring Texas hold 'em (approaching strong super-human in simpler versions of poker)
