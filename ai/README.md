### Artificial Intelligence

#### Definitions

- Branch of computer science that deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines. Research in AI is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.

#### Big Questions

- David Hilbert: "can all of mathematical reasoning be formalized?"
	- His question was answered by Gödel's incompleteness proof, Turing's machine and Church's Lambda calculus.

#### History of Artificial Intelligence

Brief history of how it started

- Began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen.
- As Pamela McCorduck writes, AI began with "an ancient wish to forge the gods."
- The seeds of modern AI were planted by classical philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the "mechanical manipulation of symbols".
- A computer is a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning.
- Aim of people in the beginning was to "seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain".
- ***KEY MOMENT***: The field of AI research was founded at a conference on the campus of Dartmouth College in the summer of 1956.

Routes of an intelligent mechanical men go far back

- Mechanical men and artificial beings appear in Greek myths, such as the golden robots of Hephaestus and Pygmalion's Galatea.
- In the Middle Ages, there were rumors of secret mystical or alchemical means of placing mind into matter, such as Jābir ibn Hayyān's Takwin, Paracelsus' homunculus and Rabbi Judah Loew's Golem.
- By the 19th century, ideas about artificial men and thinking machines were developed in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), and speculation, such as Samuel Butler's "Darwin among the Machines." AI has continued to be an important element of science fiction into the present.

People used to believe that Automatons existed within objects.

- Realistic humanoid automatons were built by craftsman from every civilization, including Yan Shi, Hero of Alexandria, Al-Jazari and Wolfgang von Kempelen. 
- The oldest known automatons were the sacred statues of ancient Egypt and Greece. The faithful believed that craftsman had imbued these figures with very real minds, capable of wisdom and emotion—Hermes Trismegistus wrote that "by discovering the true nature of the gods, man has been able to reproduce it."

Formal reasoning - VERY IMPORTANT historically in AI

- "Artificial intelligence is based on the assumption that the process of human thought can be mechanized."
- The study of mechanical—or "formal"—reasoning has a long history.
- Chinese, Indian and Greek philosophers all developed structured methods of formal deduction in the first millennium BCE.
- Their ideas were developed over the centuries by philosophers such as:
	- Aristotle (who gave a formal analysis of the syllogism)
	- Euclid (whose Elements was a model of formal reasoning)
	- al-Khwārizmī (who developed algebra and gave his name to "algorithm")
	- European scholastic philosophers such as William of Ockham and Duns Scotus.
- Majorcan philosopher Ramon Llull (1232–1315) developed several logical machines devoted to the production of knowledge by logical means;
	- Llull described his machines as mechanical entities that could combine basic and undeniable truths by simple logical operations, produced by the machine by mechanical meanings, in such ways as to produce all the possible knowledge.
	- Llull's work had a great influence on Gottfried Leibniz, who redeveloped his ideas.
- In the 17th century, Leibniz, Thomas Hobbes and René Descartes explored the possibility that all rational thought could be made as systematic as algebra or geometry.
	- Hobbes famously wrote in Leviathan: "reason is nothing but reckoning".
	- Leibniz envisioned a universal language of reasoning (his characteristica universalis) which would reduce argumentation to calculation, so that "there would be no more need of disputation between two philosophers than between two accountants. For it would suffice to take their pencils in hand, down to their slates, and to say each other (with a friend as witness, if they liked): Let us calculate."
	- These philosophers had begun to articulate the ***physical symbol system*** hypothesis that would become the guiding faith of AI research.
		- A physical symbol system (also called a formal system) takes physical patterns (symbols), combining them into structures (expressions) and manipulating them (using processes) to produce new expressions.
			- Examples of some physical symbol systems:
				- Formal logic: the symbols are words like "and", "or", "not", "for all x" and so on.
				- Algebra: the symbols are "+", "×", "x", "y", "1", "2", "3", etc. The expressions are equations.
				- A digital computer: the symbols are zeros and ones of computer memory, the processes are the operations of the CPU that change memory.
				- Chess: the symbols are the pieces, the processes are the legal chess moves, the expressions are the positions of all the pieces on the board.
			- The physical symbol system hypothesis claims that both of these are also examples of physical symbol systems:
				- Intelligent human thought: the symbols are encoded in our brains. The expressions are thoughts. The processes are the mental operations of thinking.
				- A running artificial intelligence program: The symbols are data. The expressions are more data. The processes are programs that manipulate the data.
- In the 20th century, the study of mathematical logic provided the essential breakthrough that made artificial intelligence seem plausible.
	- The foundations had been set by such works as Boole's The Laws of Thought and Frege's Begriffsschrift.
- Building on Frege's system, Russell and Whitehead presented a formal treatment of the foundations of mathematics in their masterpiece, the ***Principia Mathematica*** in 1913.
- Inspired by Russell's success, David Hilbert challenged mathematicians of the 1920s and 30s to answer this fundamental question: "can all of mathematical reasoning be formalized?"
	- His question was answered by Gödel's incompleteness proof, Turing's machine and Church's Lambda calculus. Their answer was surprising in two ways.
		1. They proved that there were, in fact, limits to what mathematical logic could accomplish.
		2. Their work suggested that, within these limits, any form of mathematical reasoning could be mechanized. 
	- The Church-Turing thesis implied that a mechanical device, shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1, could imitate any conceivable process of mathematical deduction.
	- The key insight was the ***Turing machine***—a simple theoretical construct that captured the essence of abstract symbol manipulation. This invention would inspire a handful of scientists to begin discussing the possibility of thinking machines.

All of these sets of information led to the formation of Computer Science.

- Calculating machines were built in antiquity and improved throughout history by many mathematicians, including (once again) philosopher Gottfried Leibniz.
- In the early 19th century, Charles Babbage designed a programmable computer (the Analytical Engine), although it was never built.
- Ada Lovelace speculated that the machine "might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent".
- The first modern computers were the massive code breaking machines of the Second World War (such as Z3, ENIAC and Colossus).
- The latter two of these machines were based on the theoretical foundation laid by Alan Turing and developed by John von Neumann.

The birth of AI actually happened in 1956. People started the chatter about AI in 1940s, though. The aim was to create an artificial brain.

- In the 1940s and 50s, a handful of scientists from a variety of fields (mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics and political science) began to discuss the possibility of creating an artificial brain. The field of artificial intelligence research was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.
