- The seeds of modern AI were planted by classical philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the "mechanical manipulation of symbols".
- "placing mind into matter"
- The physical symbol system hypothesis claims that both of these are also examples of physical symbol systems:
	- Intelligent human thought: the symbols are encoded in our brains. The expressions are thoughts. The processes are the mental operations of thinking.
	- A running artificial intelligence program: The symbols are data. The expressions are more data. The processes are programs that manipulate the data.

We are adding expressions, which is data. Symbols are also data. Then we run a process to manipulate and understand the data.
