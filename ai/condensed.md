1943 to 1956

- The seeds of modern AI were planted by classical philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the "mechanical manipulation of symbols".
- "placing mind into matter"
- The physical symbol system hypothesis claims that both of these are also examples of physical symbol systems:
	- Intelligent human thought: the symbols are encoded in our brains. The expressions are thoughts. The processes are the mental operations of thinking.
	- A running artificial intelligence program: The symbols are data. The expressions are more data. The processes are programs that manipulate the data.

We are adding expressions, which is data. Symbols are also data. Then we run a process to manipulate and understand the data.

1951: First neural net machine, the SNARC

- Strong AI: "solved the venerable mind/body problem, explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind."
- Game AI would continue to be used as a measure of progress in AI throughout its history.
- 1956 conference learning mission: "every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".
	- The birth of AI
	- At the conference Newell and Simon debuted the "Logic Theorist" and McCarthy persuaded the attendees to accept "Artificial Intelligence" as the name of the field.
